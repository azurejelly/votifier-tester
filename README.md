# votifier-tester

This is a project that allows you to test Votifier instances. Currently only v1 protocol is supported; v2 is coming soon.

## Development

This project requires `govendor`.

## Deployment

You can deploy this project any way you want. As-is, you can easily deploy it with Docker or Heroku. The live instance uses Heroku for now
(I'm likely to move it to a VPS at some point).

## Questions

### It's only using VanillaJS?!?

Yes.
